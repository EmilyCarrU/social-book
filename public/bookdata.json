    "content": "<p>Those tools and tactics turn out to serve us very well in the era of social media. Now that people generate content and communications in ways that go well beyond e-mail, we need to focus in ways that go far beyond a spam filter. We can thank Gary Thuerk and the spammers of the universe for helping us develop the following ways to focus our attention:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Email filtering: <\/em>Email filters, which were  <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/about_6390104_define-spam-filters.html\" -->first created to deal with spam<!-- \/a -->, have since turned into powerful tools for managing and organizing incoming email. <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) FURTHER READING <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/about_6390104_define-spam-filters.html\">Define Spam Filters<\/a><\/strong> I&#8217;m utterly <!--THIS LINK RETURNS 404 ERROR a href=\"\/20101229\/21-gmail-filters-that-will-empty-your-e-mail-inbox\" -->dependent on Gmail filters<!-- \/a --> <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/06\/22\/gmail-filters\/\">How To Filter Your Gmail Like a Pro<\/a><\/strong> in ways that go way beyond spam elimination. Without spam I might have to read and file my e-mails by hand (shudder).<\/li>\n<li><em>Attention filtering:<\/em> Email filters have inspired analogous tools on other platforms. Twitter lists, the Facebook &#8220;hide&#8221; option and the entire idea of PATH are all about filtering out extraneous content so we can focus our attention on a more limited circle of relationships or a more limited sphere of information.<\/li>\n<li><em>Texting and messaging:<\/em> Spam made us impatient about the process of plowing through our inboxes. Texting, chat and Twitter are all instant communications tools that sidestep the whole inbox nightmare by coming to us in real time. (And better yet, by being incredibly short.) Learning to communicate in very brief increments is one of the legacies of spam, and in a world that connects us to hundreds or thousands of people through a wide range of social networks, we can be grateful that some of those conversations happen briefly.<\/li>\n<li><em>Pull:<\/em> Email did a fantastic job of teaching us about the limits of push: content that gets pushed to you. As a result many of us have shifted much of our attention onto pull: content that we pull to us by choosing what to visit or subscribe to. For instance, instead of subscribing to e-newsletters, we might subscribe to blog RSS feeds. While e-newsletters are still alive and well, the shift to pull is an essential tool for people trying to manage a very high volume of information.<\/li>\n<li><em>FOAF: <\/em>The friend-of-a-friend principle has driven a wide range of social networks in which your interactions are structured around networks of trusted contacts. Relying on networks of trust is a way of  getting past the spam problem, by opening communication channels only along lines that mirror pre-existing social relationships. Just think about LinkedIn, which explicitly limits your ability to contact people based on how closely you are connected. That whole model of using social networks to construct boundaries around who gets our attention is in some part thanks to the problem of ungated attention first demonstrated by spam.<\/li>\n<li><em>Marketing with value: <\/em>Spam&#8217;s assault on e-mail delivery and opening rates first forced marketers to think about what they could actually offer to make an e-mail worth reading. That consciousness and skill set has served marketers well in the social media era, where the competition for attention is even fiercer. If some online marketing now delivers real value to its targets &#8212; think the <!-- a title=\"Dove Campaign for Real Beauty\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dove.us\/#\/cfrb\/\" -->Dove Campaign for Real Beauty<!-- \/a --><strong> (REFERENCE ICON) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dove.us\/Social-Mission\/campaign-for-real-beauty.aspx\">The Dove Campaign for Real Beauty<\/a><\/strong> or <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideastorm.com\" -->Dell&#8217;s Ideastorm<!-- \/a --> <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideastorm.com\">Dell&#8217;s Ideastorm<\/a><\/strong> &#8212; that&#8217;s because marketers have learned that providing tangible value is one way to earn people&#8217;s attention.<\/li>\n<li><em>Opt in, opt out:<\/em> To address the spam problem, many countries have laws that require all bulk e-mails to include an opt-out link, and\/or to be sent only by people who have explicitly opted into the mailing list. (Of course, these laws are ignored by all kinds of illegitimate operations, which is why spam volumes remain so high.) This has given us the idea that you don&#8217;t demand the attention of someone who hasn&#8217;t asked for your content, and that losing someone&#8217;s attention is a routine and acceptable part of our communications ecosystem. You can see that principle extended into technologies and practices like the ever-evolving policies on what appears in your Facebook news feed, and the ease of unfollowing people on Twitter.<\/li>\n<li><em>Ignoring communications<\/em>: Spam taught us that it was OK to ignore a lot of e-mail. We still have a ways to go in <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/samuel\/2011\/02\/its-time-for-a-vendetta-agains.html\" -->overcoming our notion that all e-mail deserves a reply<!-- \/a -->, <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) FURTHER READING <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/samuel\/2011\/02\/its-time-for-a-vendetta-agains.html\">It&#8217;s Time for a Vendetta Against Email<\/a><\/strong> but to the extent that we&#8217;re asserting some sense of agency over how we allocate our attention, it builds on the foundations established by spam. Once you learn how to ignore offers from Nigerian princes, it gets a lot easier to ignore irrelevant office-wide memos.<\/li>\n<li><em>Getting rich quick: <\/em>In a world that delivers daily messages about how you can get rich quick, it&#8217;s understandable that we&#8217;d lose our patience for long, slow empire-building. Maybe it&#8217;s overreaching to blame (or credit) spam for a generation of social media sites built on the business model of, &#8220;let&#8217;s build something that we can get Yahoo! or Google to buy.&#8221; But some of the startups that found their quick return through early acquisition have included some great tools for managing our information and communications (hello, <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\" -->delicious<!-- \/a --> and <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/startupnorth.ca\/2011\/03\/30\/salesforce-acquires-radian6-for-326-million\/\" -->Radian6<!-- \/a --> <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) In 2011, Salesforce bought Radian6 for $326 million.

Thanks to spam, we now know how much people like to think and talk about penises, information that has helped to drive <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.funnyordie.com\/search\/a\/videos?q=penis\" -->some of the Internet&#8217;s most successful entertainment sites<!-- \/a -->.

    "content": "<p>When Cerf and his collaborators took to the Interstate, the hard work of creating the Internet was best left to the programmers. Today, thanks largely to social media, user-generated content and the emergence of the programmable web, you can help to create the Internet without writing a single line of code. You can help create the online world in which you and your children are going to live. You can take on some of that hard work. Here&#8217;s how:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Tithe your time online. <\/em>The Internet is not a religion (usually) but it is a community. The same way that members of a religious community might contribute 10% of their income to the church, members of the Internet community can contribute 10% of their time online to the health of the network itself. If the average American now spends 13 hours a week online, that means dedicating about 80 minutes to the kinds of active contributions described in this list.<\/li>\n<li><em>Be a good colonist. <\/em>I wanted to tell you that you&#8217;re the Columbus of the Internet, but let&#8217;s face it, the Columbus thing didn&#8217;t work out too well for a whole lot of people. So do Columbus one better: as you help to discover this new world of the Internet, do it without the evangelizing, land-stealing and disease-spreading. Get to know and appreciate what already exists online and think about how to add to it. Try not to bulldoze anything (or anyone) who is already there.<\/li>\n<li>Make a node. The Internet is not a series of tubes. It&#8217;s a series of nodes and connections. You can make one of those nodes by creating your own blog or web site. It doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy. It just has to be useful or interesting to at least one other person.<\/li>\n<li><em>Aim for 49%. <\/em>That&#8217;s the maximum amount of your online energy that should go into promoting the Brand of You. (If you think you can keep it to 48%, or maybe even want to be a human being instead of a brand, so much the better.) The other 51% can go to talking about other people and ideas and maybe even to just listening. This is the hard work of building an Internet that is not simply a monument to narcissism.<\/li>\n<li><em>Make a connection.<\/em> Remember how the Internet is both nodes and connections? That&#8217;s not just a description of the Internet&#8217;s underlying architecture: it&#8217;s also a description of the way it connects information and people. You can make a connection between two pieces of information by posting a hyperlink: that is the most basic level at which the Internet connects something over here to something over there. Or you can make a connection between two people by introducing them via e-mail, tweet or blog post.<\/li>\n<li><em>Tell us how you did it.<\/em> If you&#8217;ve ever been delighted to find a tech solution, recipe or business tip online, you know that a big part of the Internet&#8217;s value is the help it provides on just about any topic.

People often say that one of the Internet&#8217;s strengths is that it is self-healing. For example, if someone writes something incorrect on a Wikipedia page, somebody else will correct it. But as that example suggests, the Internet isn&#8217;t self-healing: it&#8217;s healed by the active participation of people who take the time to correct a mistake or solve a problem. And the first step to solving a problem is knowing it&#8217;s there. Whether it&#8217;s taking a moment to report a Twitter spammer, capturing a screenshot of an error message and sending it to the site in question, or letting someone know that you got a 404 on their blog, reporting a problem can help keep the Internet shipshape.

    "content": "<p>In an online world that makes evasion a frequent option, we need to have guidance on how to make evasion a conscious choice. We need&#8230;rules. Here are mine:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Check your impact.<\/em> Before you break a rule, ask whether anyone will be directly affected by you breaking it. If someone will be affected by you breaking this rule, you need to get their consent, or you need to have a reason for imposing this effect on them without their consent. It&#8217;s beyond the scope of this blog to outline a full moral code but there are lots of moral codes around if you want to look for one.<\/li>\n<li><em>Test for universality.<\/em> Ask yourself what the social, political and\/or economic impact would be if everyone broke the rule you were about to break. In some cases, you may really like the impact: maybe it would be a better world if everyone just created music based on passion and didn&#8217;t expect to earn money from it, or if artists toured more regularly. In other cases, you may have second-thoughts about your rule-breaking: how much would it suck if <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/collider.com\/heroes-is-the-most-pirated-show-of-2009\/13541\/\" --><em>Heroes<\/em><!-- \/a -->\u00a0got cancelled because people downloaded it instead of watching it. Wait, it did get cancelled? Oh, crap.<\/li>\n<li><em>Know the rules you are (not) following. <\/em>When you&#8217;re clicking the &#8220;accept&#8221; button on a <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en\/policies\/terms\/\"-->Terms of Service agreement<!-- \/a -->, you are agreeing to a set of rules. Unless you want to make it a full-time job, or (worse yet) sign up for only a very small number of web applications and social networks, you&#8217;re going to click &#8220;accept&#8221; many many times without actually reading the rules you are agreeing to. So make a point of reading through a couple of Terms of Service just so you know the kind of rules that web apps often impose. (For example, most web sites that accept user-contributed content require you to share only content that belongs to you; no posting other people&#8217;s writing!) And if you use a lot of social media services, include at least one major social media news site in your regular online news consumption (e.g. <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/\" -->ReadWriteWeb<!-- \/a -->, <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/\"-->Mashable<!-- \/a --> or <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/\"-->TechCrunch<!-- \/a -->) since you can count on them covering any major surprises in a major web app&#8217;s terms of service.<\/li>\n<li><em>Find out who made the rules. <\/em>Most rules reflect the interests of the people who made them, whether consciously or unconsciously. The rule that you should pay for your movies is good for movie producers. The rule that you shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;fuck&#8221; is good for parents, who don&#8217;t want to have to tell their four-year-old to stop saying it (hypothetically speaking, of course). The rule that you should follow back anyone who follows you on Twitter is good for social media consultants who want to convince you that they know the rules. Know who&#8217;s behind a given rule, and you have some important clues about what&#8217;s at stake in following or defying it. That&#8217;s crucial information if you are considering whether to evade or comply.<\/li>\n<li><em>Be wary of privilege.<\/em> The fewer the people who have the power to break a rule, the more cautious you should be about breaking it. Hackers &#8212; people with serious tech chops &#8212; have the power to break a lot of rules the rest of us have to follow. Some might break the rule that says no reading about <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/june\/4\/newsid_2496000\/2496277.stm\"-->Tiananmen Square<!-- \/a -->\u00a0from within China; others might break the rule that says my web site should contain the content I put there. The relatively small number with the greatest level of tech skill have the power to break rules that could affect a lot of people &#8212; like <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.itworld.com\/internet\/129927\/hacktivist-group-anonymous-hits-sites-cut-wikileaks\"-->the power to shut down PayPal to protest its decision to stop processing donations to WikiLeaks<!-- \/a -->. <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) &#8220;In December 2010, the hacker group Anonymous organized a denial of service attack against PayPal, Amazon, Visa and MasterCard after the companies pulled their support for whistleblower site Wikileaks.&#8221; FURTHER READING <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2374090,00.asp\">WikiLeaks Supporter &#8216;Operation Payback&#8217; Targets PayPal, Amazon<\/a>\u00a0<\/strong>The effectiveness and legitimacy of civil disobedience (a very particular form of rule-breaking) has historically depended on mass participation, so if you are going to use your rule-breaking powers to engage in a more concentrated form of civil disobedience, you need to think carefully about how your rule-breaking potential empowers or undermines the efficacy of other social and political actors.<\/li>\n<li><em>Teach informed rule-breaking.<\/em> Encourage your kids to think carefully about the rules they break.

Unless you actually did quit your day job so that you could dedicate yourself to reading Terms of Service, you have probably violated someone&#8217;s TOS at some time. (If you&#8217;re anything like me, you violate a couple before breakfast.) But just in case you&#8217;re shy of your rule violation quota, start breaking rules deliberately and on a regular basis. For one thing, the pressure to find a breakage-worthy rule will force you to scrutinize all the rules you follow more carefully. For another, breaking rules is a discipline that helps you become more innovative by challenging the constraints on any situation or decision. And finally &#8212; as Steve Wozniak could have told you 36 years ago &#8212; breaking rules is fun.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n",

The idea of an attentive machine provides the fantasy that we may escape from each other. When we say we look forward to computer judges, counselors, teachers, and pastors, we comment on our disappointments with people who have not cared or who have treated us with bias or even abuse. These disappointments begin to make a machine\u2019s performance of caring seem like caring enough. We are willing to put aside a program\u2019s lack of understanding and, indeed, to work to make it seem to understand more than it does\u2014all to create the fantasy that there is an alternative to people. This is the deeper \u201cELIZA effect.\u201d Trust in ELIZA does not speak to what we think ELIZA will understand but to our lack of trust in the people who might understand.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Turkle&#8217;s analysis casts ELIZA as the beginning of our &#8220;robotic moment&#8221;. But the ICCC, of which ELIZA was just one part, was also the beginning of our networked moment: the moment when the ARPANET began to spread its wings beyond the narrow confines of research centres and universities. That moment was most fundamentally enabled by the 1972 creation of IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>IANA was responsible for assigning unique &#8216;addresses&#8217; to each computer connected to the Internet.
