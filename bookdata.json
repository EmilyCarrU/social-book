Now that people generate content and communications in ways that go well beyond e-mail, we need to focus in ways that go far beyond a spam filter. We can thank Gary Thuerk and the spammers of the universe for helping us develop the following ways to focus our attention:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Email filtering: <\/em>Email filters, which were  <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/about_6390104_define-spam-filters.html\" -->first created to deal with spam<!-- \/a -->, have since turned into powerful tools for managing and organizing incoming email. <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) FURTHER READING <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ehow.com\/about_6390104_define-spam-filters.html\">Define Spam Filters<\/a><\/strong> I&#8217;m utterly <!--THIS LINK RETURNS 404 ERROR a href=\"\/20101229\/21-gmail-filters-that-will-empty-your-e-mail-inbox\" -->dependent on Gmail filters<!-- \/a --> <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/06\/22\/gmail-filters\/\">How To Filter Your Gmail Like a Pro<\/a><\/strong> in ways that go way beyond spam elimination. Without spam I might have to read and file my e-mails by hand (shudder).<\/li>\n<li><em>Attention filtering:<\/em> Email filters have inspired analogous tools on other platforms. Twitter lists, the Facebook &#8220;hide&#8221; option and the entire idea of PATH are all about filtering out extraneous content so we can focus our attention on a more limited circle of relationships or a more limited sphere of information.<\/li>\n<li><em>Texting and messaging:<\/em> Spam made us impatient about the process of plowing through our inboxes. Texting, chat and Twitter are all instant communications tools that sidestep the whole inbox nightmare by coming to us in real time. (And better yet, by being incredibly short.) Learning to communicate in very brief increments is one of the legacies of spam, and in a world that connects us to hundreds or thousands of people through a wide range of social networks, we can be grateful that some of those conversations happen briefly.<\/li>\n<li><em>Pull:<\/em> Email did a fantastic job of teaching us about the limits of push: content that gets pushed to you. As a result many of us have shifted much of our attention onto pull: content that we pull to us by choosing what to visit or subscribe to. For instance, instead of subscribing to e-newsletters, we might subscribe to blog RSS feeds. While e-newsletters are still alive and well, the shift to pull is an essential tool for people trying to manage a very high volume of information.<\/li>\n<li><em>FOAF: <\/em>The friend-of-a-friend principle has driven a wide range of social networks in which your interactions are structured around networks of trusted contacts. Relying on networks of trust is a way of  getting past the spam problem, by opening communication channels only along lines that mirror pre-existing social relationships. Just think about LinkedIn, which explicitly limits your ability to contact people based on how closely you are connected. That whole model of using social networks to construct boundaries around who gets our attention is in some part thanks to the problem of ungated attention first demonstrated by spam.<\/li>\n<li><em>Marketing with value: <\/em>Spam&#8217;s assault on e-mail delivery and opening rates first forced marketers to think about what they could actually offer to make an e-mail worth reading. That consciousness and skill set has served marketers well in the social media era, where the competition for attention is even fiercer. If some online marketing now delivers real value to its targets &#8212; think the <!-- a title=\"Dove Campaign for Real Beauty\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dove.us\/#\/cfrb\/\" -->Dove Campaign for Real Beauty<!-- \/a --><strong> (REFERENCE ICON) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dove.us\/Social-Mission\/campaign-for-real-beauty.aspx\">The Dove Campaign for Real Beauty<\/a><\/strong> or <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideastorm.com\" -->Dell&#8217;s Ideastorm<!-- \/a --> <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ideastorm.com\">Dell&#8217;s Ideastorm<\/a><\/strong> &#8212; that&#8217;s because marketers have learned that providing tangible value is one way to earn people&#8217;s attention.<\/li>\n<li><em>Opt in, opt out:<\/em> To address the spam problem, many countries have laws that require all bulk e-mails to include an opt-out link, and\/or to be sent only by people who have explicitly opted into the mailing list. (Of course, these laws are ignored by all kinds of illegitimate operations, which is why spam volumes remain so high.) This has given us the idea that you don&#8217;t demand the attention of someone who hasn&#8217;t asked for your content, and that losing someone&#8217;s attention is a routine and acceptable part of our communications ecosystem. You can see that principle extended into technologies and practices like the ever-evolving policies on what appears in your Facebook news feed, and the ease of unfollowing people on Twitter.<\/li>\n<li><em>Ignoring communications<\/em>: Spam taught us that it was OK to ignore a lot of e-mail. We still have a ways to go in <!-- a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/samuel\/2011\/02\/its-time-for-a-vendetta-agains.html\" -->overcoming our notion that all e-mail deserves a reply<!-- \/a -->, <strong>(REFERENCE ICON) FURTHER READING <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/samuel\/2011\/02\/its-time-for-a-vendetta-agains.html\">It&#8217;s Time for a Vendetta Against Email<\/a><\/strong> but to the extent that we&#8217;re asserting some sense of agency over how we allocate our attention, it builds on the foundations established by spam. Once you learn how to ignore offers from Nigerian princes, it gets a lot easier to ignore irrelevant office-wide memos.<\/li>\n<li><em>Getting rich quick: <\/em>In a world that delivers daily messages about how you can get rich quick, it&#8217;s understandable that we&#8217;d lose our patience for long, slow empire-building.

Today, thanks largely to social media, user-generated content and the emergence of the programmable web, you can help to create the Internet without writing a single line of code. You can help create the online world in which you and your children are going to live. You can take on some of that hard work. Here&#8217;s how:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Tithe your time online. <\/em>The Internet is not a religion (usually) but it is a community. The same way that members of a religious community might contribute 10% of their income to the church, members of the Internet community can contribute 10% of their time online to the health of the network itself. If the average American now spends 13 hours a week online, that means dedicating about 80 minutes to the kinds of active contributions described in this list.<\/li>\n<li><em>Be a good colonist. <\/em>I wanted to tell you that you&#8217;re the Columbus of the Internet, but let&#8217;s face it, the Columbus thing didn&#8217;t work out too well for a whole lot of people. So do Columbus one better: as you help to discover this new world of the Internet, do it without the evangelizing, land-stealing and disease-spreading. Get to know and appreciate what already exists online and think about how to add to it. Try not to bulldoze anything (or anyone) who is already there.<\/li>\n<li>Make a node. The Internet is not a series of tubes. It&#8217;s a series of nodes and connections. You can make one of those nodes by creating your own blog or web site. It doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy. It just has to be useful or interesting to at least one other person.<\/li>\n<li><em>Aim for 49%. <\/em>That&#8217;s the maximum amount of your online energy that should go into promoting the Brand of You. (If you think you can keep it to 48%, or maybe even want to be a human being instead of a brand, so much the better.) The other 51% can go to talking about other people and ideas and maybe even to just listening. This is the hard work of building an Internet that is not simply a monument to narcissism.<\/li>\n<li><em>Make a connection.<\/em> Remember how the Internet is both nodes and connections? That&#8217;s not just a description of the Internet&#8217;s underlying architecture: it&#8217;s also a description of the way it connects information and people. You can make a connection between two pieces of information by posting a hyperlink: that is the most basic level at which the Internet connects something over here to something over there. Or you can make a connection between two people by introducing them via e-mail, tweet or blog post.<\/li>\n<li><em>Tell us how you did it.<\/em> If you&#8217;ve ever been delighted to find a tech solution, recipe or business tip online, you know that a big part of the Internet&#8217;s value is the help it provides on just about any topic.

But as that example suggests, the Internet isn&#8217;t self-healing: it&#8217;s healed by the active participation of people who take the time to correct a mistake or solve a problem. And the first step to solving a problem is knowing it&#8217;s there. Whether it&#8217;s taking a moment to report a Twitter spammer, capturing a screenshot of an error message and sending it to the site in question, or letting someone know that you got a 404 on their blog, reporting a problem can help keep the Internet shipshape.
