## Structure

The platform accomidates different kinds of books with commenting at multiple levels. The basic structure is as follows:

*Generic Book*

* Section
  * Chapter
      * Sub-Chapter

### Table of Contents

There is no explicit Table of Contents; the structure of the book _is_ the table of contents.

### Commenting

Comments may be made at either the Section, Chapter, or Sub-Chapter level. If commenting is permitted at the Section level, that book will have no Chapters or Sub-sections. If commenting is permitted at the Chapter level, that book will have no Sub-Chapters.

### Sections

_Sections are at the top level of the bookâ€™s content._

It is likely that most books linear books will only have one section. Books with multiple sections could include a play with acts, or a technical book with multiple major topics.

### Chapters

_Chapters are children of Sections._

### Sub-Chapters

_Sub-Chapters are children of Chapters._

Sub-Chapters may be any amount of content within a chapter. In some books, it could be appropriate to allow commenting at the paragraph level, so Sub-Chapters will be paragraphs.

In another book, an author may only want comments halfway through the book and at the end. Here, the first Sub-Chapter would be the first half of the book. The second Sub-Chapter would be the remainder of the chapter.

Sub-Chapters may also have commenting disabled. This way, an author could have comments enabled at the paragraph level, but only for specific paragraphs.

### Example

The following is an example of how _Frankenstein_ would work as a social book with comments at the paragraph level.
