				<p class="chap_lead">In 1976 I was in kindergarten, and like any five-year-old looked forward to the high point of each day: the arrival of our latest ditto-ed handout. For those of you under 30, let me explain that a ditto (similar to a mimeo) was a purple-inked paper used to mass-produce in-class exercises, and in the over-12 set, used for church newsletters and other low-circulation, low-budget publications. As soon as the dittos were handed out, we held them up to our faces and inhaled deeply: the smell of happiness, and as it turns out, methanol.</p>
				<p>You over-30s, take note of the fact that I had to explain this item from our collective archive. Over the past few years I&#8217;ve had a few thirtysomethings stare at me blankly when I made a passing reference to dittos. When I started school, the ditto and its ancestors had been captivating children for a full century: in fact, the mimeograph was invented by none other than Thomas Edison in 1876. But just ten years after I inhaled my first ditto in kindergarten, the ditto was more or less extinct (at least in North America), overtaken by the photocopier and the computer printer. Today&#8217;s 28-year-old American has never enjoyed the intoxicating high of methanol in the morning.</p>

				<p>The lowly classroom handout is like a radar gun for the speed of change. I&#8217;m not even 40 (yet), and I can play a very respectable game of &#8220;when I was a boy&hellip;&#8221; OK, so sniffing mimeos isn&#8217;t quite as dramatic as walking three miles to school through the proverbial snowdrifts. But when my mother was 39, there were only three everyday technologies that had become obsolete in her lifetime: passenger ships, telegrams and pantyhose.</p>
				<p>As a 39-year-old in 2011, I can rattle off a list of obsolete technologies as long as my arm (partly thanks to the good folks at PC World). Faxes, floppy disks, polaroids, rotary phones, records, answering machines, cassette tapes, typewriters, camera film, the Sony Walkman.</p>
